# Sunvox Sega Megadrive YM2612-ish-FMX Presets
This repo contains Sega Genesis sounding FMX module presets for Sunvox that I created using the OPM to FMX Pixilang convertor by Cory Culley. Most of the original instruments came from OPM files made from VOPM, Genny VST, and Wohlstand's Bank Editor. Feel free to use them in your projects! If you have any requests, post in the discussion area or fork the repo and pull request for a merge!
